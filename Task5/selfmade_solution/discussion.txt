2.1 Description
	We implemented a workflow where the input to it is just the same input as in homework04
	The output of the starting point is the input for our fibonacci function
	The output of the fibonacci function is the input for the endpoint
	The endpoints output is what is our final result, pretty straight forward

2.2 Description
	We implemented a workflow where the input is the FibonacciFCparInput.json
	This input is given to the workers function, which reads the input (N and F)
	It generates F arrays with the length N/F and the output of the worker function is a map of all arrays
	Then a parallel section is startet in within F threads are staret, each calculating their own fibonacci numbers
	The output of every thread is combined and is the output of this parallel section, the result is input for the endpoint
	The output of the endpoint of this workflow i sthe final result, an array of N fibonacci numbers

2.3 Evaluation task

Running the FC from section 2.1 gave back just the same output as in homework04
Running the FC from section 2.2 gave us a slightly different output, as the numbers where not in correct order, but have been correctly calculated
	This is the case because the results are written in whichever order the threads would finnish.
