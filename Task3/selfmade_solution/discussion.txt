Measure the time required for the Tasks 1.-6. of the previous step, as well as the time required for the complete execution of the application.

The time required for the Tasks 1.-6. is 356s, the time required complete execution of the application is 6m7s

Compare the results of the measurement to the time required for the execution of the application from Task 2, in particular w.r.t. the initialization overhead.

Last week the complete application one machine took 6m 33s, but this time it took 6m 7s. By using Docker we improved the initalization process by downloading a smaller java sdk and getting rid of the seperate file uploads.
